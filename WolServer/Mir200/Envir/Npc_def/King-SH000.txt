When you request guild war, name of same guild member will appear\
in blue colour. on the other side, name of enemy guild member will\
appear orange.
If you connect during a Guild war, the message:\
"War with certain guild" will appear in chat window and\
if you kill a member of the enemy guild fighting with you, you\
will not be regarded as a murderer.
